            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Agustin — a Game Producer with a technical background. My experience helps me bridge the gap between creative vision and technical execution, allowing me to work hand-in-hand with dev teams to bring ambitious ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of development, I’m a dedicated "Cat Father" 🐱 and a tabletop enthusiast. You can usually find me crafting adventures as a Dungeon Master, testing new board games, or playing TCGs like Digimon and MTG.

						As a Producer on the core development team, I bridged the gap between Engineering, Art, and QA, ensuring everyone was moving toward the same goals. I worked alongside the Game Director to manage the backlog and define quarterly objectives, guiding the team to a successful Soft Launch in Europe and North America.
					</p>
					<p>
						To reduce rework, I introduced technical audits for design docs, catching feasibility issues before they reached engineering. I championed the implementation of CI/CD to ensure we always had fresh, playable builds, allowing us to quickly validate gameplay mechanics.
					</p>
					<p>
						I oversaw the development of custom tools to empower our designers, giving them the ability to build and tweak content independently, reducing their reliance on engineering support.

                            I joined the project during the final months of production to address schedule slippage. Acting as an Associate Producer, I worked with the Design and Development teams to renegotiate scope—prioritizing quality to ensure we met strict publisher deadlines.

                        <p>
                            Simultaneously, I drove the porting efforts for the Nintendo Switch version. I managed the Dev and QA teams through the certification pipelines, achieving a successful Day 1 launch on both Steam and Switch, followed by a smooth release on Xbox.

                    		This project involved some heavy technical lifting. I guided the team through a major engine upgrade (Unity 2018 to 2022) and a complete networking migration from UNET to Mirror to ensure stable online multiplayer.
